- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @nowitsanurag
- ðŸ‘€ I have a knowledge of Artificial intelligence (Machine Learning & Deep Learning), Mysql and Python.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working as a Product Manager.
- I believe in being proactive rather than reactive. 
- Being focused, persistent, goal-oriented, and realistic helps me accomplish my objectives. 
- It is also an added advantage of mine to be a quick learner. 
- A good team player but also knows when to step up and lead a team if need arises.



### My Digital Garden ðŸŒ±

I write regular blog posts, most of which you will find on my personal website [Easy Learning](https://easylearning-platform.blogspot.com/).

I write about things I am familiar with, things that trip up folks that I mentor, and things that I am learning.  Day to day I make things with **data** using **python**.
